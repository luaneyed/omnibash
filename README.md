# awesome-scripts #

Add following lines to .bash_profile
```
export SCRIPTS_PATH=[PATH TO YOUR CLONE]  
source $SCRIPTS_PATH'aliases';
```
You must **not** change the name of variable 'SCRIPTS_PATH' because it is referenced in scripts

SCRIPTS_PATH must equal to the path of your clone.

ex) export SCRIPTS_PATH=$HOME'/awesome-scripts/'
